Cool Transition - By Simon Price - 10/7/00

About :

I've seen a load of special effects ideas on www.planet-source-code.com and so I thought of a different idea for a change (since I had seen alot of similar ideas there). I'm not saying that I invented this technique, I think the proper  name for it is alpha-blending. But all the code here is my own work, I have not seen any source code that does this. I got the idea from the fact that DirectX does this and I was wondering if it were possible in pure VB code wothout DirectX without a stupid amount of loading time. Well, it is possible, but (there's always a catch) to do it with any speed, I had to make memory buffers and lookup tables and it all takes 1.44 MB RAM! But that's no problem for most computers nowadays so it's OK.
